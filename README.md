# 2Old2Intern

2Old2Intern is a Python-based AI tool designed to evaluate resumes for desirability and likability using a voting ensemble of models. Each model offers its own critique, and their combined judgments aim to surface patterns or issues a single reader might miss.

At its core, this project is about addressing a very human limitation: our tendency toward tunnel vision. Whether reviewing our own resumes or assessing creative work, we often struggle to imagine how something might be perceived differently. 2Old2Intern simulates diverse perspectives to break through that cognitive bottleneck.

Though focused on resumes, the underlying approach—using AI ensembles to highlight blind spots—can be applied to any evaluative task. This is a hobby project, treated as an engineering exploration rather than a scientific study. The goal is to test the feasibility of voting-based synthesis for qualitative feedback, especially where imagination runs dry.
